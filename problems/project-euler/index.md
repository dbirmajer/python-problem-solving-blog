## üî• Solution Highlights

### Most Elegant
**Problem 6**: `sum(range(101)) ** 2 - sum(x**2 for x in range(101))`

### Most Creative  
**Problem 1**: `sum(x for x in range(1_000) if (x % 5) * (x % 3) == 0)`

### Best Use of Libraries
**Problem 3**: `max(primes.factorise(600_851_475_143))`

### Most Functional
**Problem 5**: `reduce(lcm, range(1, 21))`
